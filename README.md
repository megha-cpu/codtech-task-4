# codtech-task-4

**COMPANY:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME:** MEGHANA ANIPIREDDY

**INTERN ID:** CT06DG2670

**DOMAIN:** MACHINE LEARNING

**DURATION:** 6 WEEEKS

**MENTOR:** NEELA SANTOSH

**üìù Task Overview**
This repository contains my implementation for Task 4 of the internship, which focuses on building a Recommendation System using either Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization techniques. The aim of the project is to predict user preferences and generate personalized item recommendations based on their past interactions or similar user behaviors.

Recommendation Systems are widely used in modern applications such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to improve user engagement and satisfaction by showing relevant content.

**üîç Task Instructions**
As per the internship guidelines:

Objective: Build a functional Recommendation System

Approach: Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization

Deliverable: A Jupyter Notebook or App showcasing:

Recommendation logic

Model output

Evaluation metrics

**üìä Dataset**
The system was developed using the [insert dataset name here, e.g., MovieLens, Amazon Reviews, Book-Crossing dataset], which includes user-item interactions such as:

User IDs

Item/Product/Movie IDs

Ratings or feedback (explicit or implicit)

Sample Dataset Structure:
User ID	Item ID	Rating
101	200	5.0
102	201	3.0

The dataset was preprocessed by:

Removing duplicates or null values

Filtering active users and frequently rated items

Encoding IDs for matrix construction

**üß† Model Building
‚úÖ Implemented Techniques:**
Collaborative Filtering (Memory-Based):

User-User or Item-Item similarity using cosine similarity

Matrix Factorization (Model-Based):

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) using Surprise library

Alternating Least Squares (ALS) in case of implicit datasets

**üß™ Model Evaluation:**
Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20)

Metrics used:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Precision@K and Recall@K for top-K recommendation evaluation

**üéØ Output**
The system successfully generates personalized recommendations for users.
Screenshots/outputs showing sample recommendations and evaluation metrics are included (e.g., recommendation_results.png, model_evaluation_metrics.png).

Example Output:

User 102 ‚Üí Recommended Movies: Inception, The Matrix, Interstellar

You can find the detailed recommendation output and evaluation metrics in the Jupyter Notebook.

**üìà Results & Insights**
The model achieved an RMSE of [insert value] on the test dataset.

SVD-based matrix factorization outperformed basic collaborative filtering in terms of accuracy and scalability.

Precision and recall were higher for top-rated users with more interactions.

**üìö Conclusion**
This project provided in-depth experience in building a personalized Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. It deepened my understanding of user-item interaction modeling and evaluation in real-world data.

Potential Improvements:
Apply content-based filtering or hybrid models

Incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, views)

Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

üîß Tech Stack
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Surprise Library

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for evaluation visualizations)
